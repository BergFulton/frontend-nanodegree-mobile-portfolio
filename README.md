##Udacity FEND Web Optimization Project
###Janky Pizzas everywhere! 

###What is this? 
This is my submission for the Udacity Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree Project 5- web optimization. 

The project starts as a very janky, and very ugly (Sorry, Cameron) portfolio, and students must use their JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Gulp, and basically any other tool they can think of to get:    
1) A Pagespeed Insights score of 90/100 on desktop _and_ mobile  
2) A jank free scroll on the `views/pizza.html` page  
3) A .5ms resize of the pizzas on `views/pizza.html` page

###How can I see it?
First, put on your sunglasses. This page isn't pretty. But restyling wasn't part of the course, and there's only so hours...

1) But for real, first, clone this repo into a local directory.   
 **Before continuing, do you have `npm` and `gulp` working on your machine? If not, do that now. Documentation for NodeJS [is here](https://nodejs.org/en/) and  Gulp [is here](http://gulpjs.com/). You need these, trust me.**

2) In the terminal, navigate to the local directory where you've put this repo, and  type `npm install`.

3) Then type `gulp`. 
   After you type `gulp`, you'll see a bunch of things happen in the terminal. That's good! `gulp` is minifying images and code, optimizing them for the web. 

4) After `gulp` has finished, you'll see a file called `index-critical.html` in your local directory. Open that in your browser of choice. 

###What does this all mean?
